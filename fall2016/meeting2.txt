Went over Vagrant, hypervisor, puppet.

ramk, jacluu, and raymondng teamed up and chose the Office Hours project.

ramk had to leave early because he was on duty.

We set up the UPE stack on candidate's machines. ramk had to leave early so he will run his stuff
later. The setup worked perfectly for jacluu. raymondng had a lot of problems on his Windows 10
laptop so tmochida will be helping him after the meeting set it up.

We went over different models and parts of the website.

Next week we will cover basic HTML, CSS, and JS.
